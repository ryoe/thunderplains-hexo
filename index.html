everyone. But the best minds of our generation are thinking about how
to make people click ads. That sucks. Are we working on the right
things? This talk tells the story of the Code for Tulsa brigade, and
why you can use web development to make your city, our state, and
maybe our world a better place.</p></div></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>9:30am-10:20am</time></div><div class="schedule-slot"><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room1"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Real World React.js</h3><h4>Aaron Murray</h4></div><p>Talk Description Coming Soon</p></div><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room2"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Genome.js</h3><h4>Eric Schoffstall</h4></div><p>Talk Description Coming Soon</p></div><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room3"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Building Massive Angular Apps</h3><h4>Gordon Bockus</h4></div><p>I will be describing in detail why organizing and preparing your
team and project for when it gets large is an obvious win over the
lifetime of a web application. Specifically talking about how
spending some time and effort considering the long term implications
of up front design and tooling decisions will result in a better
organized and easily maintained project as it gets MASSIVE!  I'll go
into detail about tools, processes, can best practices that will help
make the project scalable and maintainable.  There will be a section
that is specific to Angular applications taking about 1/3 of the
available time.</p></div></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>10:30am-11:20am</time></div><div class="schedule-slot"><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room1"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Making Magic with Node.js and Redis</h3><h4>Waylon Flinn</h4></div><p>Ever wanted to make a game? How about a recommendation engine? Come
hear how Crunch Magic mixed Node.js and Redis into a potion that does
both.</p></div><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room2"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Your Grandparents Probably Didn't Have Node</h3><h4>Jenn Schiffer</h4></div><p>Using build tools and public git repositories allow developers to
create for and distribute our work to...other developers. But what
about artists and writers and other non-developers who don't know how
to open terminal, let alone run `npm install`? I'm going to talk
about how I entered this problem space by building a drawing app and
learning how to document and distribute code in a way that people of
all technical and non-technical backgrounds can enjoy it.</p></div><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room3"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Server-less dashboards powered by Web Components</h3><h4>Sebastien Cevey</h4></div><p>Tired of spinning servers to host monitoring dashboards? Fed up
with writing scripts to graph your metrics?<br/><br/>At the Guardian, we have built Web Components that fetch deployment and
monitoring stats and pipe the data into customisable graphs, so that you can
assemble live dashboards in plain HTML without having to write any JavaScript.<br/><br/>Moreover, by relying on open REST APIs and the AWS JavaScript SDK, the custom
elements running in your browser talk directly to your monitoring APIs
(CloudWatch, Graphite, etc.) using a 2-tiered architecture, without any
intermediate server.  The dashboards can therefore be hosted as static files,
e.g. on S3 or even run locally.<br/><br/>There are associated challenges with such an architecture around
authentication, security and responsive design of Web Components, but the talk
aims to demonstrate how new web technologies can be combined to build rich
dynamic systems in a simple, declarative style.</p></div></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>11:30pm-1:00pm</time></div><div class="schedule-event"><p>Lunch Break</p></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>1:00pm-1:50pm</time></div><div class="schedule-slot"><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room1"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Mobile Applications with Javascript and Ionic</h3><h4>Josh Bavari</h4></div><p>Theres two things I am absolutely passionate about:<br/><br/>1) Cordova for mobile applications<br/>2) JavaScript<br/><br/>Using the Javascript framework Ionic built on top of Cordova, it's
easy to make slick mobile applications built with web technologies.
Ionic is built with several components from AngularJS, is open
source, and has an ever growing user base with forums. Lets embrace
JavaScript and make apps that are capable of running on your mobile
phone through an app or a web browser.</p></div><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room2"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Leveraging Hypermedia to Build Rich Applications</h3><h4>Sebastian Cevey</h4></div><p>Composer is a rich Single-Page Application (AngularJS), backed by a
set of loosely coupled APIs for managing content, tags, media, etc.
While each API may differ in hosting, implementation, they all adhere
to the principle of Hypermedia, a more faithful implementation of the
REST architecture defined by Roy Fielding. Typically, the result is
a self-documenting, evolveable and highly cacheable API, which relies
on links and affordances to describe how to navigate and interact
with resources, very much like HTML does for the Web.<br/><br/>In this talk, I would like to demonstrate how the Guardian CMS
leverages a shared API media-type to make development faster and
more robust, by exposing the API structure in the responses
alongside the data. All a client needs to know is the root URL,
from which it can dynamically discover the available actions and
present the UI accordingly. No details of the server are hardcoded
in the clients, which makes them more robust to changes and simpler
to implement.<br/><br/>We have developed the `argo' media-type to power our Hypermedia
API, and started open sourcing a standalone API client for it at
<a href="https://github.com/theefer/argonaut">https://github.com/theefer/argonaut</a></p></div><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room3"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Johnny Five is Alive</h3><h4>Dereck Bailey</h4></div><p>Talk Description Coming Soon</p></div></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>2:00pm-2:50pm</time></div><div class="schedule-slot"><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room1"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Use Your Words!</h3><h4>Tracy Hinds</h4></div><p>Twitter flame wars.
Open source project failures through contributor fallout.
Bullying that leads to the bullying of bullies.<br/><br/>How do we maintain our communities? How do we grow them? How is
anyone in their right mind stepping into the caustic social media
environment of programming we have created for ourselves?<br/><br/>There are steps we can take with user groups, conferences, online
worlds that can help support an inclusive environment that allows
for debate, learning, growing, and excitement. The social sciences
have 100 years of research that can provide us with tools to
treat our fellow programmers with care. Much of this has been
battle-tested in the organizations we run. The bubbles we live
in. Let's share how we're creating a better world that is
welcoming to programmers, new and experienced, so that we're
leading by example. <br/><br/>Your words are powerful, and  <em>“actions speak louder than words, but
not nearly as often.”</em></p></div><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room2"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Supercharge Your Productivity with Ember.js</h3><h4>Jeremy Green</h4></div><p>Ember is an opinionated application framework.  Like many
opinionated frameworks things get much easier when you learn what
those opinions are, and why they are in place. This session will
bring you up to speed on the concepts represented by all of the major
parts of the framework, and you'll be well on your way to quickly
delivering highly interactive applications.<br/><br/>MVC is a popular pattern used in both server side and client side frameworks.
Unfortunately due to the differences in focus, some of the common words and
phrases can become overloaded and confused.  This session will dive into the
specific parts of server and client side MVC patterns, comparing and
contrasting each part of the system.  Code examples will be in Ruby on Rails
for the server, and Ember.js for the client, but the concepts will be broadly
applicable to other languages.</p></div><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room3"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>Better Living through Control Flow Graph Generation</h3><h4>Chris Dickenson</h4></div><p>This talk will be an introduction to the data structures and phases
involved in parsing (tokenization, abstract syntax trees, control
flow graph generation), and what useful tools can be built on the
various derived formats of your code. The overarching theme is that
dealing with your code on a different level of abstraction gives you
superpowers. This talk will include information about control flow
graphs + doing code review, static analysis, and optimization with
that intermediate format.</p></div></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>3:00pm-3:30pm</time></div><div class="schedule-event"><p>Break</p></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>3:30pm-4:20pm</time></div><div class="schedule-slot"><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room1"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>NodeBots Wearables: JavaScripting Your Wardrobe</h3><h4>Kassandra</h4></div><p>As NodeBots platforms get more and more diverse, they're also
getting smaller and easier to build and program. This talk explores
crafting wearable tech using sensors, outputs, and all written in JS.
This includes sewing together robotics pieces, dealing with stray
wires, and other wearables-specific challenges.</p></div><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room2"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>So tell me again why we're not using node.js?</h3><h4>Jordan Rousseau</h4></div><p>Two years ago at WDT, the technology solution for any web
application was LAMP. My breaking point was us investigating Zend PHP
to expand our application capabilities. I was over it, we knew
JavaScript and there was a great new (but a bit unstable) platform
out that was starting to make some noise. It was time to make a
change.<br/><br/>I went through struggles with management, other developers and most definitely
myself on whether or not node.js was the right technology (spoiler alert, it
might not be).<br/><br/>I want to share my experiences and tips on how to make the decision if node is
right for your company and how to convince others (and especially yourself)
that node will work and it's not really going out on a limb.</p></div><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room3"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt=""/><h3>The Importance of Building Developer Communities</h3><h4>Jennifer Wadella</h4></div><p>Today, companies are competing for technology talent more than for
business. As a developer, you have more power than you may realize.
You have the power to shape our technology landscape and build the
kind of companies for which you want to work (and not just by
founding them). Google doesn’t hold the monopoly on developer culture
nor does Silicon Valley hold the monopoly on job opportunities in
innovation. Learn how as a developer at any level of the corporate
ladder you can make an impact in your company, and Kansas City,
through building developer communities.</p></div></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>4:30pm-5:20pm</time></div><div class="schedule-keynote"><p>Closing Keynote</p><div class="schedule-talk"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="images/speakers/tba.png" alt="Chris Williams"/><h3>Democratizing Hardware</h3><h4>Chris Williams</h4></div><p>With the rise of widely available chipsets, open source hardware
components, and makerspaces, the only thing holding back the coming
Hardware Revolution is... the arcane languages needed to program
them. While most of the development industry has pushed forward into
far more accessible and expressive languages, the domain of hardware
has been stuck in the 1980's. With the rise of NodeBots, which
started as node.js robots but is now inclusive of all languages, the
trend toward making hardware hacking accessible to all has grown
stronger and broader. <br/><br/>As a gatekeeper between the two worlds, due to being the author of
node-serialport, I have been witness to this amazing trend and would like to
invite you to join us as we bring robots, copters, boats, and rockets, but most
importantly the maker movement to all software and web developers.</p></div></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>5:30pm-6:00pm</time></div><div class="schedule-event"><p>Closing Remarks &amp; Prize Drawing</p></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>6:30pm - ?</time></div><div class="schedule-event"><p>After Party (Off-site)</p></div></div></section><section id="passes" class="container"><h2 class="section-title">Passes</h2><ul class="passes-list row"><li class="pass-lightning"><a href="https://techlahoma.ticketbud.com/thunderplains-2k14"><div class="pass-title col-md-8"><h3>Lightning</h3><br/>First 20 tickets sold</div><div class="pass-price col-md-4">$85<sup>00</sup></div></a></li><li class="pass-thunder"><a href="https://techlahoma.ticketbud.com/thunderplains-2k14"><div class="pass-title col-md-8"><h3>Thunder</h3><br/>Through August 15<sup>th</sup></div><div class="pass-price col-md-4">$100<sup>00</sup></div></a></li><li class="pass-rain"><a href="https://techlahoma.ticketbud.com/thunderplains-2k14"><div class="pass-title col-md-8"><h3>Rain</h3><br/>Through September 12<sup>th</sup></div><div class="pass-price col-md-4">$110<sup>00</sup></div></a></li><li class="pass-regular"><a href="https://techlahoma.ticketbud.com/thunderplains-2k14"><div class="pass-title col-md-8"><h3>Regular Pass</h3><br/>Through October 8<sup>th</sup></div><div class="pass-price col-md-4">$125<sup>00</sup></div></a></li><li class="pass-onsite"><a href="https://techlahoma.ticketbud.com/thunderplains-2k14"><div class="pass-title col-md-8"><h3>Onsite Pass</h3><br/>At the door</div><div class="pass-price col-md-4">$150<sup>00</sup></div></a></li><li class="pass-students"><a href="https://techlahoma.ticketbud.com/thunderplains-2k14"><div class="pass-title col-md-8"><h3>Students</h3><br/>w/ valid Student ID</div><div class="pass-price col-md-4">$85<sup>00</sup></div></a></li><li class="pass-bulk"><a href="https://techlahoma.ticketbud.com/thunderplains-2k14"><div class="pass-title col-md-8"><h3>Herd</h3><br/>5 or more tickets (bulk only)</div><div class="pass-price col-md-4">$100<sup>00/ea</sup></div></a></li></ul></section><section id="coc"><div class="container"><h2 class="section-title">Code of Conduct</h2><p>Before attending the conference, <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com">please review the Thunder Plains Code of Conduct</a>.
